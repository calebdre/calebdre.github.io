title: Guide to learning Back-End Web Development
---

So you want to be a master Back-End developer eh? There are lots of resources for getting
started and learning online. What I want to do with this article is give you a curated 
and opinionated guide on what you need to know - you don't have to dig through and figure out
what to learn. I've done it for you! 

Another point is to give learners an opportunity to ask any kind of question without fear.
If you don't understand something or have any questions or need advice, definitely email me 
at [mentor@caleblewis.me](mailto:mentor@caleblewis.me).   
  
On to the learning path!  
  
## The Internet

First thing's first: you're going to be making applications for the internet, 
so you'll need to know how exactly the internet works from a web application
context.

## Text Editors
Before we get into it, we'll need a place to write our code. While learning, you might the term 
'text editor'  'IDE (integrated development environment)' come up. It's good to know the 
difference and when to use either one.   
  
Basically: text editors are programs like Notes or Wordpad that gives you an easy way to 
write content (like code) to files. An IDE is a text editor with lots of features that
help you write code. 
  
[Here's an article on the pros/cons of using either one](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2015/12/22/ide-vs-text-editor/)  

People can have arguments all day about which one is better, but the most important thing
is being proficient. The goal is to choose an editor/IDE that you will stick to and become
as procient as possible in them. Learn all the shortcuts and settings that helps you generate
the best code at the fastest rate. 

## HTML & CSS  
When creating web applications using fancy and exotic tools, frameworks, and languages, 
all you're really doing is generating HTML. That's it. The goal is to generate the markup
that you need onto the webpage. For that reason, it's important to get a good understanding of how html works and be
decent at creating html pages.  
  
HTML (~How to Meet Ladies~ HyperText Markup Language) is the basic building block of the web.
Browsers use HTML files to find out what content you want and how you want the page the be structured.

[This is a comprehensive overview of HTML (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDyJN7qQETA)    
  
CSS (Cascading StyleSheets) is what the browser reads to find out how you want the page to look.
This is a little bit more difficult to wrap your head around than HTML, but it's still relatively 
simple.

## PHP
Honestly,it does not matter what language you start out with using - it only matters that you choose
one and learn all of the concepts needed. Concepts are language-agnostic.  
  
For this guide i'll reccomend learning PHP because of its ubiquity in web development.  
  
First thing's first - if you remember from the 'what is internet' video, you'll know that 
in order to program with PHP, you'll need a server that will execute PHP and serve the result
to the browser. 
  
[XAMPP is a good program that will put a web server on your computer (video) (windows)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArsbbtkF0ps)  
[If you have OSX, MAMP is pretty good (website)](https://www.mamp.info/en/)  
  
Once you have something to run your PHP scripts, you can check out these intro to PHP resources:
