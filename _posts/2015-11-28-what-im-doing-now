I'm in Atlanta hacking on cool things and sharing it with the world. In an attempt to stay focused and 
reduce distractions, here is what I spend **all** my time doing (in order of priority):  
  
- School work (currently taking 4 classes / 13 credits)
- Growing [PantherHackers](http://pantherhackers.com), a club that I started
at Georgia State University that aims to spread hacker cultue at the school.
- Creating modern and useful android apps (links coming soon)
- Writing blog posts about modern backend and android development
- Getting back in shape! 

Those are my priorities right now. I am, however, open to other opportunities.   
If my activities or priorities change, i'll update this post.
